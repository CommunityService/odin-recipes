# odin-recipes

This is supposed to be some kind of self reflection on how far I have come. 
I guess it is a good idea to do this from time to time so that I don't get lost in the hustle. 
This final project, a basic HTML website, is about recipes â€” a few pages and images. 
It is basic stuff, but the amount of fun I am having learning this stuff is unlike anything before. 
At least, it is unlike any other kind of skill learning I have done before. 
I guess this is the part before the dessert of dispair. 
Can't wait to get there.
