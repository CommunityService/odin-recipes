        <h3>Better than the blue box stuff.</h3>
        <P>We love macaroni and cheese in all forms at our house: <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/quick_macaroni_and_cheese/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>from scratch on the stovetop</strong></a>, baked in the oven with a crown of buttery breadcrumbs, and especially from a box mix. Those little orange or blue boxes have been my friends since I was a kid. They represented simple, comforting meals I could make myself. Ditto the years I spent as a clueless adult making my way in the world. Before our daughter was born, about once a week her dad and I gloriously slummed it on Trader Joe’s classic macaroni and cheese enriched with cut-up hot dogs and frozen peas. </P>
        <p>Now my daughter’s the one who consumes boxed macaroni and cheese as if it were its own food group. I wanted to wrangle a little more control over what goes into it, so I developed my own. We’re delighted with the results and I think you will be, too. All you need for the “box” are three ingredients, and then–just like with the legit kind–you add milk and/or butter when it’s time to prepare it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dry cheese powder</li>
            <li>For cheese creamer</li>
            <li>Just buy Kraft, ok?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put powder into pan</li>
            <li>Put pasta into pan</li>
            <li>Add some heat, in some way</li>
            <li>And I'm pretty sure it works after that</li>
        </ol>
