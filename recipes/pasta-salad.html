    <h3>This pasta salad recipe is sure to hit you in the feels with its spicy kick and creamy texture.</h3>
    <p>Pasta salad (pasta fredda) is a salad dish prepared with one or more types of pasta, almost always chilled, and most often tossed in a vinegar, oil, or mayonnaise-based dressing. It is typically served as an appetizer, side dish or a main course. Pasta salad is often regarded as a spring or summertime meal, but it can be served any time of year.</p>
    <p>The ingredients used vary widely by region, restaurant, seasonal availability, and/or preference of the preparer. The salad can be as simple as cold macaroni mixed with mayonnaise (a macaroni salad), or as elaborate as several pastas tossed together with a vinaigrette and a variety of fresh, preserved or cooked ingredients. Additional types of pasta may be used, such as ditalini.[2] These can include vegetables, legumes, cheeses, nuts, herbs, spices, meats, poultry, or seafood.[3] Broccoli, carrot, baby corn, cucumber, olives, onion, beans, chick peas, peppers, and parmesan or feta cheeses are all popular ingredients in versions typically found at North American salad bars.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>9 ounces pasta (fusilli, rotini, elbows, etc.)</li>
        <li>1 can (15-oz) cannellini beans (or chickpeas, rinsed)</li>
        <li>1 heaping cup cucumber (diced)</li>
        <li>Â½ cup corn (canned)</li>
    </ul>    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water as per package instructions.
            Drain it and rinse it under cold water for 15 seconds so it doesn't overcook and keeps al dente. While the pasta cooks, you can prep the veggies.</li>
        <li>To a large bowl, add all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Toss well until the pasta is thoroughly coated. Taste and adjust for mayo, salt, and lemon juice based on your preference.
            Serve immediately or store in the fridge covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container.</li>      
    </ol>
